week: 14

Students will share their final projects. 


## Final Project Expectations: 

- If you are building a user (learner / teacher / parent) facing tool: (1) User interface (front end) that clearly outlines how you imagine users using this tool. (2) At least one AI functionality to be fully functioning within this tool. 
- If you are building an AI model, or an AI workflow (e.g. AI models reasoning math thinking): (1) A fully functioning back-end showing your AI's generated response, accompanied by a detailed specification of how this AI is meant to function. (2) A prototype of what the learner facing interaction will look like. In this case, a front-end back-end integration is encouraged, but not required. 

In both cases, you must clearly outline how you imagine that AI is making an impact on a learning environment or a learning outcome. Ideally, you will have measured this impact, or outlined a way to measure this impact with your target audience.

## Project Presentations: 
- Add your presentation slides in the [final project folder.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1llLehwlK_Mw5dDJzCWizntVzKHbco2eu?usp=drive_link)
- Time: 8 minutes + 2 minutes for questions 
1. Team introductions 
1. Hook: Interesting one liner about your project 
1. Target audience
1. Problem statement / user need 
1. Prototype demo 
1. Design process / lessons 
1. Evaluation plan 
1. Findings (if any)
1. Next steps 

## Project Report Requirements: 
- Add your project reports in the [final project folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1llLehwlK_Mw5dDJzCWizntVzKHbco2eu?usp=drive_link). Two options: 

1. You may create a PDF document with a paper style formating, OR 
1. you may choose to use your [github page website](https://xdai-nyu.github.io/projects/). If you use your website, add a googe doc in the submission folder with your project website link, and please format your website well (fix the bold formating, add bullets, link the appropriate links, etc.). [Here are some formating tips for markdown pages.](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) 

## Final project report required sections [maximum 8 pages, reasonable font size, use any format]: 

1. Abstract: A one paragraph summary of your project. 
1. Introduction: A 1 pager describing the target audience, the need you identified, the research questions or problem statement, the prorotype design, and findings in brief. 
1. System design: Add your design features (from the feature mapping), your early prototypes, and your design process here. 
1. Prototype: Add a description of your final project prorotype here. Call out all the features and describe what works. 
1. Evaluation: A 1 pager about what you wish to evaluate, what data needs to be collected to evaluate this, and how you will conduct this evaluation. 
1. Findings: If you conducted any evaluation. 
1. Ethical implications: What you foresee as ethical and societal implications of your work, and how you plan to mitigate them. 
1. Future work or next steps
