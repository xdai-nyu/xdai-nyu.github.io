title: How Large Language Models (LLMs) work & Evaluation
week: 10
date: 2025-11-05
---

Using simulation activities, students learn about Attention Models, Transformers, Large Language models, how ChatGPT works (generative pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning from human feedback). They participate in a game simulating the experience of building a dataset of a character, and training themselves as a model, and using the model to make predictions. Using visualizations and metaphors, students learn about Convolutional Neural Networks, Diffusion models and CLIP. They participate in a game simulating generating drawings based on training data from hypothetical doodle datasets.
