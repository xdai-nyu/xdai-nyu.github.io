title: Societal and Ethical Implications of AI - II + Evaluations
week: 13 [Online]
date: 2025-11-26
---

Instructor will share some evaluation good practices and examples. 

Students will practice prompt structuring with LLMs. 

Guest Speaker: AI researcher [Jocelyn Shen](https://jocelynshen.com/) will share her work on AI, social interaction & empathy. 

<!-- Students will present the current state of their project prototype, and evaluation plan or early data, and receive peer and instructor feedback. 

Students will participate in a debate-style AI Audit game, where they will set up hypothetical AI learning businesses, and challenge their competitors with the lens of societal and ethical implications. They will utilize the Ethical implications handout to form an informed critique of, and design mitigation steps for, AI applications in learning. Through this debate game, students will research, and reflect on the ethical and societal implications of everyday AI systems. -->

<!-- ## Assignment [Code Activity]
To be added. -->

## Project Update 6
1. Create an evaluation plan for your prototype. Think of what you will want to measure to evaluate the efficacy of your tool. Do this early. Determine your: 

- Metrics of success - What you plan to achieve with this tool. You can limit it to the main key variables of succes. (e.g. concept retention, creativity, emotion recognition, etc.)
- Measures - How will you meausre these metrics? (e.g. user feedback, errors made in interaction, creative ideas generated, etc.)
- Data Collection Methods - How will you collect the information needed to measure these? ()
- Data Analysis Methods - How will you analyze this data? (e.g. Qualitative thematic analysis, Quantitative comparison between groups, etc.)
- Findings - What you found with early analysis with users (or proxy users, e.g. your peers)

1. Add your evaluation plan to your git sites. 

1. Get ready for your final presentations NEXT week (Dec 3rd)!
