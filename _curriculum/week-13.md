title: Societal and Ethical Implications of AI - II + Evaluations
week: 13
date: 2025-11-26
---

Instructor will share some evaluation good practices and examples. 

Students will present the current state of their project prototype, and evaluation plan or early data, and receive peer and instructor feedback. 

Students will participate in a debate-style AI Audit game, where they will set up hypothetical AI learning businesses, and challenge their competitors with the lens of societal and ethical implications. They will utilize the Ethical implications handout to form an informed critique of, and design mitigation steps for, AI applications in learning. Through this debate game, students will research, and reflect on the ethical and societal implications of everyday AI systems.

## Project Update 6
1. Update your project websites to include an ethical implications, and a societal implications section (1-2 paragraphs). Discuss how your approach in your project may mitigate AI harms. Make sure to add this section on your project site. 
1. Add slides in your project update with (1) Your prototype demo. (2) Your evaluation plan, or evaluation results if you got a chance to test it early. Think of what you will want to measure to evaluate the efficacy of your tool. You will present these in the next class. 5 minutes presentation time.
