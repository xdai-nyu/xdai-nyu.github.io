Students will share their prototype progress with their peers. 

Safinah will go over building AI Agents.

Safinah will discuss ways of evaution. 

Students will reproduce their feature design maps for their projects and share their prototyping progress with peers.

## Assignment 6
Update your course websites with your prototype progress and your feature maps. Add your prototype as an interactive link, or a video. View a peer team's project that is assigned to you, and think of yourself as potential users of the product to provide some early feedback. Provide them with the following feedback: 

1. Are the  user/learner/teacher needs well communicated?
2. Are the design features relating well to the needs that are described? Explain. 
3. What do you find the most valuable about this design product? 
4. Are there ethical implications that you are concerned about?
