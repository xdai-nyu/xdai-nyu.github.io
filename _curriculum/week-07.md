## Project Update 3
Students will use the needfinding techniques discussed in class to investigate user/learner needs in their chosen topic. Update your github pages to add findings from your needfinding activities. 

Students will write their design plan for their final project. This will include rapid paper prototypes, sketches, blueprints, or design plans. 

Nothing is due this week - see next week for submission info.
