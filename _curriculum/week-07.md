## Project Update 2
Groups will present their needfinding reports and project focus in this class. 5 mins + questions per group. 

Students will write their design plan for their final project. This will include rapid paper prototypes, sketches, blueprints, or design plans. 

## Project Update 2
Students will work on their literature review, and needfinding reports, and submit them on Github. 

1.  Conduct a literature review in the use of technology (any technology) addressing the learning needs they identified. They will write two accounts of projects or papers addressing (or failing to address) those learning needs. 
1.  Students will use the needfinding techniques discussed in class to investigate user/learner needs in their chosen topic. 
1.  Add your needfinding methods and findings to your project page on Github. 
1.  Revisit your project's problem statement, and make adaptations to it based on your needfinding report. Would your learning needs change? Would how you use AI change? Make those edits in the initial part of your github page (from previous week).


**Project Update Submission: Add your needfinding report to your Github page** *(due on 10/14, 7:00 PM EST)*
