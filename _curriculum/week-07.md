## AI Prototyping 
We will discuss the basics of NLP and computer vision. We will learn to deploy a small chatbot, and a vision tool. We will learn to create with ML5. 


## Project Design Features
Students will clearly lay out some needs that they are trying to solve. They will then outline how they play to solve these needs. They will write about how they plan to utilize different types of AI in their design. Students will review the design plan for NotebookLM. For homework, students will begin to create low fidelity prototypes of their own design plans.  

## Project Update 2
Students will work on their literature review, and needfinding reports, and submit them on Github. 

1.  Conduct a literature review in the use of technology (any technology) addressing the learning needs they identified. They will write two accounts of projects or papers addressing (or failing to address) those learning needs. 
1.  Students will use the needfinding techniques discussed in class to investigate user/learner needs in their chosen topic. 
1.  Add your needfinding methods and findings to your project page on Github. 
1.  Revisit your project's problem statement, and make adaptations to it based on your needfinding report. Would your learning needs change? Would how you use AI change? Make those edits in the initial part of your github page (from previous week).


**Project Update Submission: Add your needfinding report to your Github page** *(due on 10/14, 7:00 PM EST)*

**No readings this week**
