title: Societal and Ethical Implications of AI - I 
week: 12
date: 2025-11-19
---

Students will dive deeper into current fairness, accountability and transparency concerns in AI. Students will learn about the dangers of large language models, particularly in learning. Students will dive deeper into bias, data privacy and security, equity, learner autonomy, plagiarism, emotional well-being, AI hype, accountability, implications on the future of work, misinformation, environmental impact, and power dynamics in AI ecosystems. We will discuss the uncanny valley, and digital presence and persuasive powers of generative AI personas. We will also consider when not to use AI. 

## In-class Activity
Students will interact with the Bias Explorer to understand bias in visual AI systems, and how societal stereotypes are represented in AI-generated media.
