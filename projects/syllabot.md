### Target Learning Audience: 
Pre-K and elementary school students 
### Modalities: 
A combination of screen-based interactions and physical engagement with a robotic toy.

### Identified Learner Needs
Young learners (ages 3-10) often struggle with attention, phonics, word recognition, and comprehension, requiring interactive and multimodal reinforcement from an instructive body (Ehri, 2005). Traditional reading instruction lacks personalization and fails to address the diverse needs of early learners, especially those with short attention spans or learning difficulties. Research in cognitive science suggests that multimodal learning technologies — combining visual, auditory, and kinesthetic interactions — may enhance retention and comprehension (Mayer, 2021). Indeed, interactive multimedia approaches to literacy education, such as games (Franceschini et al., 2015; Gorgen et al., 2020), apps (Chuang et al., 2023) and augmented reality books (Şimşek et al., 2023) have been developed in response. These tools have shown to enhance the reading experience and improve learning, especially for students with learning disabilities. 

However, these tools also have multiple limitations. Many of them feature pre-defined stories and require the use of screens, limiting the meaningfulness of the reading content and the potential for embodied cognition to reinforce the representation of literacy concepts. Further, parents remain skeptical of digital applications as a replacement for traditional books (Kucirkova et al., 2020; Azir et al., 2022). Finally, many of these applications still require or encourage parental involvement, which can be hard on busy parents and parents of slow readers (Mudzielwana, 2014; Melody’s personal experience). Few learning designers have explored how AI-enhanced social robots have the potential to target all of these issues by personalizing, physicalizing, and autonomizing the process of learning to read. 

### Rationale for AI Assistance
Our project leverages AI-driven personalization, interactive storytelling, and embodied cognition to create a more engaging and effective reading experience. A social robot with a visual interface will collaborate with the learner to develop a custom gamified storytelling experience in which the robot prompts the learner to read instructions for physical actions to be acted out related to the story. Real-time assessment, gradual visual hints, collaboration, and physical movement facilitated by the robotic toy will support the learner in decoding words, improving fluency, and reinforcing memory while also engaging their creative and physical senses. These approaches align with constructivist learning theories, emphasizing active participation and meaningful interaction in literacy development.

### Problem Statement
Young learners (ages 3-10) often struggle with attention, phonics, and comprehension, requiring interactive, multimodal support. Traditional reading instruction lacks personalization, making literacy development challenging. This project introduces an AI-driven robotic reading companion that adapts to each child’s progress using speech recognition, eye tracking, and embodied cognition. By integrating phonics-based hints, visual aids, and physical engagement, it enhances fluency, comprehension, and retention, bridging a critical gap in early literacy education.

## Identified Learner needs
### 1. Personalized Reading Support
_“Young learners vary in their reading abilities, attention spans, and learning styles, yet traditional instruction often provides a one-size-fits-all approach. Personalized feedback, phonics-based hints, and real-time assessment help children progress at their own pace, reinforcing prior knowledge while addressing individual learning gaps.”_

### 2. Multimodal Engagement for Retention
_“Many children struggle with focus and comprehension when learning through static or text-based instruction. By integrating visual aids, auditory cues, and interactive storytelling, the system enhances engagement and supports decoding, fluency, and memory retention through germane cognition.”_

### 3. Embodied Cognition for Active Learning
_“Young children benefit from physical interaction as part of the learning process, particularly those with short attention spans or sensory learning preferences. Encouraging movement through embodied cognition—such as acting out stories—reinforces literacy skills by linking learning to muscle memory and increasing sustained engagement.”_

## Research Goals and Methodology
### Goal
The survey data we collected focused on understanding the reading habits, challenges, and toy interaction preferences of children between the ages of 3 and 10. 

### Key areas of focus
• Background information

• Reading habits

• Reading challenges

• Attitudes on AI

• Toy design preferences

• Physical embodiment

### Methodolgy
Our methodology is structured around a mixed-methods approach that combines quantitative and qualitative analysis to understand how children engage with reading and interactive toys, as well as to inform the design of an AI reading companion.

**Target Audience:** Parents of children 3-10

**Sample Size:** 6 parents, 10 children

**Voluntary Participation:** Participants were self-selected, meaning they opted to respond based on their interest.

**Research method:** 30 questions, survey-based

## Midterm reflection

Melody: I'm glad we gathered feedback from parents before starting the design phase of our project. I'm curious to see how all the secondary research and perspectives come together as we develop the prototype for the trial with participating parents and children.
