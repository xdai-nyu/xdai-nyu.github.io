**Target Learning Audience:**
Young adults who are struggling with mental health issues, and a secondary target audience for individuals who are particularly interested in therapeutic arts

**Identified Learning Need**
For our project, we would like our target audience to be young adults who are struggling with emotional mental health issues. Mental health awareness is a pivotal issue among young adults. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) statistics shows that young adults (age 18-25) have the highest rates of mental illness. We would like to address these issues through the lens of art inquiry and creative arts therapy. We will create an interactive virtual art experience, which will include an in-person component that can be implemented by a young adult icon to create engagement and enhance reliability or a tour guide. We hope this app will support young adults by equipping them with therapeutic skills on how to navigate their emotional issues through creativity and art (visual art, poems, music and digital takeaways).

**Rationale for AI Assistance**
• Recommendation of content tailored to user emotions via sentiment analysis algorithms (e.g., comforting poetry, color-based art suggestions, music generation)
• Detection of negative emotional patterns and guidance on emotion regulation techniques to facilitate creative shifts
• Establishment of a human-AI collaborative socio-emotional learning environment to enhance interaction between users and offline components (guides or leaders)
AI can provide enhanced digital support, such as offering positive content for users. This will allow AI to create algorithms to identify and analyze emotions cues from user input. AI can guide the users through therapeutic techniques that work to help manage and remove negative emotions and thought patterns by applying creative art outlets. We also want to implement a social emotional element within our app that will work as a human AI collaborative learning experience. This will allow the user to interact with the in-person component to enhance engagement and social emotional awareness and development.
