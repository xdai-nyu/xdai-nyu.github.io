### Target Learning Audience 10/14/2025
High school & College students who are making ***an art portfolio***
   
### New Introduction and Rational for AI Assistance updated 10/14/2025
For portfolio projects, users do not know which ones to choose in order to best showcase their personal ability, and do not understand the preferences and focus of the viewers of the portfolio, resulting in a lack of targeted production ideas. For those who have never created a portfolio, it is easy to affect professionalism due to disorderly layout and outdated aesthetics. The statement content does not know how to distinguish the priority and reading order of information through font size, color, image retention, etc., resulting in poor page reading experience and difficulty for viewers of the portfolio to quickly grasp the key points.

AI Portfolio Planner Chatbot, the main goal is to serve high school and college students who are creating portfolios, helping them plan and provide feedback on their portfolios, leaving them with more time to refine their artistic creations. Users can use AI to brainstorm and fill in the gaps in design ideas. Hence, AI can serve as a scaffold to assist students in organizing design ideas. At the same time, for inexperienced students who may feel lost, AI can act as a starting assistant.

### Account 1: The Enhanced Role of Generative AI in Artistic Creation
<details>
<summary>Our learning goal is to enable students to more conveniently and accurately master the planning and process of creating art portfolios through generative AI–assisted learning.</summary>

The reason for choosing this learning goal is that in today’s educational environment, even within the high school student population, there is significant variation in how students understand art, recognize their own strengths and interests, and approach portfolio creation. Many students feel confused and anxious about the academic journey ahead and are uncertain how to present their artistic capabilities in a way that gains recognition from schools. Traditional portfolio planning often requires students to explore unfamiliar processes, categories, and research paths on their own, which can be overwhelming and inefficient. Our product serves as an intelligent assistant that provides personalized guidance tailored to each student’s background, level of understanding, and creative goals. This individualized support not only reduces the inefficiency caused by trial-and-error in the early stages but also significantly accelerates the research and planning process, enabling students to focus more of their time and energy on refining their work and developing their artistic expression.

In the early stages of product development, as creators, we also need evidence that the learning goals we set are meaningful and achievable. The following research offers a strong example that supports our approach.

He, Y., & Zhang, S. (2025). Enhancing art creation through AI-based generative adversarial networks in educational auxiliary systems. Scientific Reports, August 2025. At the beginning of this paper, the authors note that “Creative art education increasingly requires interactive, personalized tools that support students in developing aesthetic expression and technical skills” (He & Zhang, 2025), which aligns closely with the core idea behind our product.

This paper introduces an AI-enhanced educational assistance system based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with the following specific functions:

1. A modular AI structure that generates sketches or style transformations based on students’ descriptions.


2. Multi-mode user interaction capable of analyzing student-drawn images and providing feedback and suggestions for improvement.


3. A progressive preview of students’ next steps and design thinking.


4. A learning management system compatible with existing platforms (such as Canvas and Moodle) that supports collaborative learning.


Compared with the product we aim to develop, the system described in the paper offers more features and broader functionality. It can iterate continuously based on model training, balance diverse artistic requirements, and deliver targeted feedback in real time. Furthermore, the authors emphasize that the system is suitable for automatic deployment in remote learning environments, supports interdisciplinary applications, and operates with extremely low training costs (He & Zhang, 2025).

The system has already been validated through classroom experiments involving 60 undergraduate students. Compared with traditional digital art tools, students who used the AI-based system achieved an average score increase of 35.4%, and their participation levels rose by 42.7% (He & Zhang, 2025).

Overall, generative AI can offer substantial support to students in the field of art. The success of such models highlights their strong potential in the educational sector and their ability to transform how students plan, create, and refine their artistic portfolios.

### Account 2
<details>
<summary>expand</summary>
   In The Integration of AI in Design Thinking for Enhancing Student Creativity and Critical Thinking in Digital Media Learning (Hashim et al., 2025), for students creating portfolios. The study highlights that beginners face significant learning hurdles in conceptualizing designs from scratch, as well as coherently describing and structuring portfolio ideas using professional terminology. Researchers discovered that while many learners are familiar with portfolios and possess numerous creative ideas, they struggle to articulate how to plan and execute an effective portfolio. Artificial intelligence tools can assist learners by providing inspiration, helping them overcome the initial hurdles of starting and building a portfolio. The paper mentions that AI excels at refining ideas and translating them into clear and coherent concepts. The author concludes that AI scaffolding directly addresses beginners' cognitive bottlenecks, effectively translating abstract creative concepts. However, the article cautions that without reflection, students may over-reliance on AI-generated expressions, potentially obscuring their authentic ideas.

## Needfinding Reports 10/14/2025

### Methodology
We plan to use **surveys** and **affinity maps** to collect data, which is a very intuitive and easy to study way of data collection and analysis. We will first create a survey and distribute it, mainly targeting high school and college students who are creating or preparing to create art portfolios. They may be confused about the different requirements of different schools, have some questions about their own art styles that they are not good at, or are halfway through and don't know what to do next. These questions will be covered in our survey, and the answers of the respondents will become the basis for our data analysis. After successfully collecting a sufficient number of responses, we will start analyzing the frequency of various multiple-choice answers and the content of open-ended questions, and classify these answers. Affinity map is a good choice, which allows us to post each observed situation in the designated classification area like sticky notes. This makes data analysis more convenient and intuitive, and we can quickly identify the common needs and areas of disagreement of the respondents, and provide improvement strategies for our products based on this data.

### Survey Result
Through this survey, we identified several significant issues: While most people create portfolios primarily for school applications or job searches, many remain unclear about how to tailor their content to different objectives. Many think about their portfolio descriptions as lacking logical coherence and depth, and they also lack awareness of industry standards.

When creating a portfolio, the most troublesome and time-consuming parts are writing reflective summaries, organizing work, and obtaining feedback from peers or experts. Many also mention struggling with layout design, unsure how to make their portfolio visually appealing while meeting professional standards. Regarding AI, most hope it can help structure their portfolio, check alignment with industry trends, and select layout templates. Ultimately, the open-ended responses reveal a common pain point: “having ideas but not knowing how to turn them into a visually appealing portfolio,” or “not knowing where to even begin.” This indicates that many lack clarity on portfolio direction, have insufficient depth in their content, struggle with design execution, and are hoping AI can provide more assistance.

[Survey Result](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KMZs2aAsG590TKEYRnngxvY_jvZTG0EH/view?usp=sharing)

### Key Findings
**Clear purpose, but unclear direction**: Most people create portfolios for school applications or job hunting, yet they don't know how to tailor content for different purposes (e.g., job applications vs. school applications). As a result, the focus of their portfolios often lacks specificity.

**Lack of depth and illogical structure are common issues**: Many people think about how their portfolio project descriptions are too superficial and lack clear logic, and they struggle to make the content appear more ‘professional,’ which makes the work seem unprofessional.

**Writing reflections and getting feedback are the most time-consuming tasks**: Everyone thinks about the hardest parts being writing project reflections (not knowing what to write) and obtaining external feedback (no one to help review), with these two steps taking the most time.

**Layout and aesthetics are major pain points**: Many people mention that “the real headache is the layout,” unsure how to make their portfolios both visually appealing and well-organized. Many have the content, but don't know how to present it effectively.

## Research Question 10/6/2025
In what ways does the AI planner help students identify their personal artistic strengths and specialties, and how accurate are these identifications from the learners’ perspectives?

As this is the initial phase of the project, we have done our utmost to implement several features. Below are the features we have implemented:
Implementing AI Conversation Functionality - We have already implemented the conversation feature. However, it is not yet perfect. The first issue is API stability, which we believe is relatively straightforward to resolve since we are familiar with the Gemini and GBT APIs. The second issue is that the AI's responses are overly verbose and complex. We want the AI to guide users toward creating portfolios using concise language.

We've prepared Q&A questions for users to gradually guide them in understanding what a portfolio is. However, the pre-written answers we've prepared are too lengthy, and we need to streamline this section. Additionally, we aim to create an adaptive environment for users. This means that when users ask relevant questions, corresponding prompts will appear in the dialog box, allowing them to quickly click on questions to inquire. Of course, this approach is relatively difficult to implement, so we'll place it at the end of the project timeline for modification.

At first, we didn't know how to design the entire interactive page. We've been striving to create a user-friendly interface. However, when we add new features, some elements become buggy, causing issues where users are unable to click buttons or the buttons become unresponsive. We are still working on a fix for this, and other challenges that we are facing is that dynamically displaying prompts. This requires the AI to understand chat content in real time and dynamically show relevant prompts to guide users to click. but, we haven't resolve this yet. Another difficulty is limiting the length of AI responses. Previous tests revealed that AI responses were consistently too lengthy, and we're actively working on fixing that.

## History
Idenitified Learning Need 10/6/2025

For those who are making a portfolio for the first time, they are not familiar with the content, production ideas, and layout of the portfolio design statement. The biggest challenge for users is not knowing how to start and not being sure what the target audience wants to see the most. It is also difficult for users to describe the project background, goals, and solutions in professional and insightful language within the industry. The content is often too colloquial and difficult to reflect depth of thinking. 

According to research, some people lacked the organization skill even if they had the good ideas upon the problem, they were unable to organize their ideas (Khadka, T, 2012). For portfolio projects, users do not know which ones to choose in order to best showcase their personal ability, and do not understand the preferences and focus of the viewers of the portfolio, resulting in a lack of targeted production ideas. For those who have never created a portfolio, it is easy to affect professionalism due to disorderly layout and outdated aesthetics. The statement content does not know how to distinguish the priority and reading order of information through font size, color, image retention, etc., resulting in poor page reading experience and difficulty for viewers of the portfolio to quickly grasp the key points.
