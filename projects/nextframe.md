### Project Title
Artflow - AI Portfolio Planner

### Project Description
An AI led web application that helps young artists to plan a portfolio. 

### Research Question
In what ways does the AI planner help students identify their personal artistic strengths and specialties, and how accurate are these identifications from the learnersâ€™ perspectives?

### Target Learning Audience
High school students who are making ***an art portfolio***

### Idenitified Learning Need
For those who are making a portfolio for the first time, they are not familiar with the content, production ideas, and layout of the portfolio design statement. The biggest challenge for users is not knowing how to start and not being sure what the target audience wants to see the most. It is also difficult for users to describe the project background, goals, and solutions in professional and insightful language within the industry. The content is often too colloquial and difficult to reflect depth of thinking. 

According to research, some people lacked the organization skill even if they had the good ideas upon the problem, they were unable to organize their ideas (Khadka, T, 2012). For portfolio projects, users do not know which ones to choose in order to best showcase their personal ability, and do not understand the preferences and focus of the viewers of the portfolio, resulting in a lack of targeted production ideas. For those who have never created a portfolio, it is easy to affect professionalism due to disorderly layout and outdated aesthetics. The statement content does not know how to distinguish the priority and reading order of information through font size, color, image retention, etc., resulting in poor page reading experience and difficulty for viewers of the portfolio to quickly grasp the key points.

*Siwen's note: As a portfolio teacher and someone who used to struggle with making a personal portfolio, the needs for guidence on portfolio are real!! I need it, my students need it...*
   

### Rational for AI Assistance
Users need to use AI to brainstorm and fill in the gaps in design ideas. Hence, AI can serve as a scaffold to assist students in organizing design ideas. At the same time, for inexperienced students who may feel lost, AI can act as a starting assistant. According to Human-AI Collaboration (Dhillon et al., 2024), research has shown a U-shaped impact of scaffolding on quality of works and productivity (words/time). While low scaffolding did not significantly improve writing quality or productivity, high scaffolding led to significant improvements, especially benefiting non-regular writers and less tech-savvy users (Dhillon et al., 2024). AI has expanded users' creative boundaries and knowledge base, enabling them to quickly scan and analyze massive amounts of images and text, and extract key information. AI can easily combine elements from different fields, increasing the depth of portfolio projects. This can compress the workload of traditional manual search from weeks to hours, allowing users to focus more on their design ideas. According to research, AI creating could have been more task efficient and had more flexibility adapting to various environments (Boynagryan & Tshngryan, 2024). Users can also use AI to assist in optimizing uploaded content, analyzing the latest trends and successful cases in the target industry of their portfolio, highlighting professional insights into key skills, and helping users better generate multiple arrangement layouts to achieve rapid optimization.

### Team Contribution
Siwen created the following: GitHub layout & updates, initial project ideas, XMind logic chart, and provided initial concepts. Zhaonan purchased Xmind Team Plan so we can collaborate on the logic chart of the app together.
We brainstormed together and finalized the idenitified learning needs and rational for AI assistance. Deqi and Zichong drafted those sections and the references. Zhaonan, Zhengyang, and Siwen then revised the written sections and refined them.
