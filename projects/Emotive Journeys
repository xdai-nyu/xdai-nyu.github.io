# Emotive Journeys
## AI-Powered experience that connects therapeutic arts with emotional expression

## Project Scope

**Target Learning Audience:**
Young adults who are struggling with mental health issues, and a secondary target audience for individuals who are particularly interested in therapeutic arts

**Identified Learning Need**
For our project, we would like our target audience to be young adults who are struggling with emotional mental health issues. Mental health awareness is a pivotal issue among young adults. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) statistics shows that young adults (age 18-25) have the highest rates of mental illness. We would like to address these issues through the lens of art inquiry and creative arts therapy. We will create an interactive virtual art experience, which will include an in-person component that can be implemented by a young adult icon to create engagement and enhance reliability or a tour guide. We hope this app will support young adults by equipping them with therapeutic skills on how to navigate their emotional issues through creativity and art (visual art, poems, music and digital takeaways).

**Rationale for AI Assistance**
• Recommendation of content tailored to user emotions via sentiment analysis algorithms (e.g., comforting poetry, color-based art suggestions, music generation)
• Detection of negative emotional patterns and guidance on emotion regulation techniques to facilitate creative shifts
• Establishment of a human-AI collaborative socio-emotional learning environment to enhance interaction between users and offline components (guides or leaders)
AI can provide enhanced digital support, such as offering positive content for users. This will allow AI to create algorithms to identify and analyze emotions cues from user input. AI can guide the users through therapeutic techniques that work to help manage and remove negative emotions and thought patterns by applying creative art outlets. We also want to implement a social emotional element within our app that will work as a human AI collaborative learning experience. This will allow the user to interact with the in-person component to enhance engagement and social emotional awareness and development.

## Needfinding 

### Learner Needs

- There is a need to detect negative emotional patterns to address and help identify
recurring negative thoughts and behaviors.
- There is a need to enhance interaction between users and digital support
content and identify which digital support elements should be implemented to address
this need. This will help to create progress tracking and personalized activities for a
more personalized and effective experience.
- There is a need to implement a social emotional element to work as a social
emotional element that will provide an impactful human AI collaborative experience for
users. Implementing a social element through dialogue and social interactions promotes
collaborative learning because this allows users to have the opportunity to use
communication as an expression of their independent thoughts. The collaboration
creates connections and a flow for users to engage with digital content and acquire
meaning making.

Literature Review
Insights From Art Therapists on Using AI-Generated Art in Art Therapy: Mixed Methods Study (Shih PC. 2024)

Art therapists affiliated with the American Art Therapy Association participated in this study where they evaluated how AI can be implanted as a digital tool to garner an understanding of its impact as a therapeutic tool. They engaged in individual interviews where they discussed their professional experiences with integrating AI into their therapeutic approaches and evaluating their use of AI as a prototype. The prototype consisted of a series of cards, and an AI generated picture. They created a persona by using Al generators via ChatGPT and Adobe express to develop a prototype. They used Adobe Express Generative AI to Image function so they could create a picture with images on cards. This provided a visual of the user’s selected emotions and feelings with a list of relevant words reflecting various emotions (emotions, feelings, relation, companion, environment, and visual). They discovered that participants were able to express their emotions and thoughts in a beneficial way. This helped them gain confidence and was beneficial for creative expression in their emotional journey. Similarly to this study, we believe AI can be implemented to assist with emotional regulation that will help users feel secure with processing their feelings and emotional expressions.

**Team contributions** 
We are a group of two and will divide the work on an as needed basis. The contributions below are indications of who will be leading the action item but both group members will be participating in every step.
1. Latisha: Research, creative arts therapy, UI/UX design and project management.
2. Jenn Choi: UI/UX design, visual storytelling, project management and service blueprint.
