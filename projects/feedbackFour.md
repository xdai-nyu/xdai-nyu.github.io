## Project Title
AI assistant for career feedback and optimization


## High-Level Summary
Adults 18+ + Professional Training Simulations & Resources + AI Feedback & Personal Optimization

An AI assistant designed to help early-career professionals navigate job searching by providing personalized skill-building recommendations, career matching, and resume optimization based on their background and goals.

## Target Audience
Adults 18+ seeking resources and personal assistance to achieve their professional goals 

Adults 18+ including undergraduate and graduate students and early-career professionals navigating the job market who seek personalized guidance to improve their job application process and professional growth.
They often struggle with preparing for interviews, managing job-related information across multiple platforms, tracking application updates and learning how to reflect and grow from their job-search experiences.

## Learning Need
Many students face the dual challenges of information overload and insufficient guidance in their career decision-making process, leading to widespread career choice anxiety, waste of resources, and employment mismatch…

Recent data indicate that early-career professionals and graduating students are facing unprecedented challenges entering the job market. According to Cengage Group’s 2025 Graduate Employability Report, only 30% of recent graduates have secured full-time jobs related to their degrees, while nearly half feel unprepared to apply for entry-level positions (Cengage Group, 2025). Similarly, a Quartz analysis citing Revelio Labs reported that entry-level job listings have dropped 35% since 2023, intensifying competition among job seekers (Quartz, 2025).

These statistics reveal a growing disconnect between academic preparation and professional readiness. Many students and young professionals struggle with information overload, career decision-making anxiety and fragmented guidance spread across multiple platforms. Without structured reflection or personalized assistance, they often rely on trial-and-error strategies, which may lead to burnout, inefficient job searching and limited skill transfer.

Therefore, there is a clear need for integrated, intelligent career support systems that can guide learners through goal-setting, skill identification and application improvement in a holistic and adaptive manner.


Studies have shown that undergraduate and early-career job seekers often experience high levels of stress and anxiety during the job search process. Job-seeking anxiety among college students is largely caused by job competition and the extended period of job preparation, as well as the time spent searching for jobs online and seeking employment guidance (Kim, Oh, & Rajaguru, 2022) Additionally, recent data indicate that early-career professionals and graduating students are facing unprecedented challenges entering the job market. According to Cengage Group’s 2025 Graduate Employability Report, only 30% of recent graduates have secured full-time jobs related to their degrees, while nearly half feel unprepared to apply for entry-level positions (Cengage Group, 2025). 

AI potential/Benefits

Anxiety and Mental Health
“Job-seeking anxiety perceived by college students is caused by job competition, as well as the increase in the period of job preparation. According to several studies, many students spend plenty of time searching jobs on job search portals and the internet, and also seeking consultancy regarding employment” [7,12,13,15,18] 

Employment
“Fresh research underscores the challenge new graduates face. Research firm Revelio Labs recently found that entry-level job listings are down 35% since 2023. Similarly, according to Cengage Group’s 2025 Employability Report, just 30% of this year’s graduating class have found full-time jobs related to their degree, while nearly half say they feel unprepared even to apply for entry-level positions.”

## Rationale for AI Assistance
AI assistance is critical in addressing the challenges students and early-career professionals face during the job search process. Studies have shown that AI-based interventions significantly enhance student performance and knowledge retention by customizing instruction and providing adaptive feedback that helps manage cognitive load across diverse learning contexts (Zhang et al., 2023; PMC11852728).
In this context, AI enables personalized career learning, tailoring feedback, skill recommendations, and job-matching insights to each user’s unique background, goals, and learning preferences. This ensures that learners engage with guidance relevant to their personal experiences and expectations. Moreover, AI enhances efficiency by analyzing resumes, job postings, and performance data at scale—providing actionable insights that save time and reduce the stress associated with information overload.
Finally, AI supports adaptive and reflective learning. As users interact with the system, it can continuously learn from their choices and outcomes, refining its recommendations to promote ongoing self-awareness and professional growth. Through these mechanisms, AI acts as both a personalized coach and an intelligent facilitator who can help the learners reduce anxiety, optimize strategies, and improve their job-search outcomes.
