## Project Brief:

Research indicates that ASMR can positively impact emotional and physiological states, reducing depression, improving concentration, and lower stress levels (Engelbregt et al., 2022; Poerio et al., 2018). These effects suggest that ASMR could be a valuable tool for enhancing learning experiences by promoting relaxation and focus. However, existing ASMR content is not personalized, and users must search manually for sounds that suit their preferences and learning needs. So, there is a need for a tool that allows users to customize AI-generated ASMR audio based on their individual learning preferences. By integrating AI-driven customization, the tool could enhance learning efficiency by providing a tailored auditory environment that optimizes focus and well-being.
