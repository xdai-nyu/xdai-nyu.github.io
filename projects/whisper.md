## AI-Generated ASMR: Enhancing Learning Through Sound and Relaxation

## Team Name:

Whisper

## Project Members:

George Wang, Jingying Deng

## Project Brief:

Research indicates that auditory and visual stimuli can significantly influence learning efficiency, emotional states, and cognitive processes (Akhshabi & Dortaj, 2023; Angwin et al., 2017; Gallego-Gómez et al., 2020; Jakubowski & Ghosh, 2019; Söderlund et al., 2021). Auditory elements, such as background music and white noise, have been found to reduce stress, enhance memory retention, and improve focus. Similarly, visual content tailored to individual preferences can boost engagement and motivation in learning settings (Harris & McDonald, 2016). However, current tools do not integrate both modalities into a personalized learning experience.

To address this gap, our project develops an AI-powered tool that enables users to generate personalized music and images tailored to their learning preferences. The system utilizes AI-generated images as desktop wallpapers and synchronizes them with background music, creating an immersive and optimized learning environment. The goal is to enhance focus, regulate emotions, and improve cognitive efficiency during study or work sessions.

## **Need Finding**
Through secondary research and user studies, we identified the following core needs:

1. **Improved Focus and Concentration:** Many learners struggle with distractions, making it difficult to maintain focus for extended periods. Personalized auditory-visual environments can filter distractions and promote deeper concentration.
2. **Emotional Regulation:** Anxiety, stress, and fatigue negatively impact cognitive performance. Music and visual stimuli can help regulate emotions, providing a calming yet engaging atmosphere.
3. **Personalized Learning Environments:** Individuals have unique preferences for background noise and visual aesthetics. AI-driven customization ensures each user receives an optimized learning experience.
4. **Cognitive Load Management:** Reducing extraneous cognitive load by balancing visual and auditory elements allows learners to absorb and retain information more effectively.
