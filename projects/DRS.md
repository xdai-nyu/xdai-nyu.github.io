## Project Brief:  
A learning management system (LMS) is a software that acts as an online learning hub that hosts learning content, tasks, assessments, collaboration between pupils, scoring, and feedback. The LMS has been used to present learning content in an educational and professional setting, targeting college students and working professionals. Previous research found that an LMS and its experience must be designed thoughtfully to address their diversity in prior knowledge, self-regulation, and metacognitive skills (Sridharan, S., Saravanan, D., Srinivasan, A., & Murugan, B. (2021). On the other hand, educators also face challenges in organizing content, providing feedback, and maximizing online discussion facilities through the LMS (Rafi, I., Nurjannah, F., Fabella, I., & Andayani, S.,2020). This indicates a need for students and educators to be supported in their LMS use.
