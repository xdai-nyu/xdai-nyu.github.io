### Problem Space

American students are struggling in math. Researchers measured “sharp, steep declines” in competency scores between 2019 and 2023 (Carr, 2024). The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) recorded a loss of 18 points by 4th graders and 27 points by 8th graders — the largest drop since the U.S. joined the study in 1995 (Schwartz, 2024). These losses may be partially attributable to education disruptions during the COVID-19 pandemic, but declines were seen prior to the pandemic (Schwartz, 2024), and other studies show a mixed picture and minimal recovery post-pandemic (NAEP, 2024).

This is occurring in a context wherein students broadly report disinterest in academic mathematics. 49% of middle and high school respondents to American Youth Panel surveys (a nationally representative group of ~2,000 youth ages 12–21 who regularly complete surveys via email and text message about attitudes, behaviors, school experiences, and other issues affecting their lives) reported losing interest in math about half or more of the time, and 75% reported losing interest for at least some class time (Schwartz et al., 2025). This loss of interest is consistent across genders and racial and ethnic groups (Schwartz et al., 2025).

- “The students who are the most likely to maintain interest in math are the same ones who comprehend math, feel supported in math, are confident in their ability to do well in math, enjoy math, believe in the need to learn math, and see themselves as a math person.” (Schwartz et al., 2025, p. 1)  
- “The students who are the most prone to disengage in math lessons want fewer online activities and more real-world applications in their math classes.” (Schwartz et al., 2025, p. 1)  
- “Thirty percent of middle and high school students said that they have never considered themselves a ‘math person.’ Those who did identify as math people developed this view during elementary school, suggesting that elementary school math teachers have a large role in cultivating positive math attitudes.” (Schwartz et al., 2025, press release)

At the most negative end of the spectrum of students’ experiences with math is **math anxiety**, which is increasing worldwide (Schwartz, 2024).

Definition, symptoms, and impacts of math anxiety are detailed in the following quotes:

> “Mathematics anxiety is a negative emotional reaction towards mathematics that can be described as ‘feelings of tension, apprehension, or fear that interfere with mathematical performance’ (Richardson & Suinn, 1972, p. 551)...”  
> *(Smith, Fotou, & Sharpe, 2025, pp. 1–2)*  

> “Mathematics anxiety is therefore significantly associated with mathematics avoidance behaviours and a wide spectrum of self-motivation measures (Hembree, 1990)...”  
> *(Smith, Fotou, & Sharpe, 2025, pp. 1–2)*

There is also evidence that students worldwide broadly report disliking academic math and failing to see its relevance. Research by educational psychologist John P. Smith III substantiates this assessment, finding that “mathematical reasoning in workplaces differs markedly from the algorithms taught in school.” *(Need to find citation!)*

Overall, this situation constitutes a **“Wicked Problem”** (Rittel & Webber, 1973).

Solutions to Wicked Problems are never truly “right” or “wrong.” The goal is to contribute to making a massive, complex, multifaceted situation ***better.*** So what contribution might we make?

If we were to make a word cloud around the concept of mathematics in education today, “performance” and “achievement” would figure prominently. Performance and achievement are valued from an academic point of view as indicators of content mastery and transferability.  
**But are they relevant to *learning?* Are there other ways to cultivate, describe, or measure engagement and learning in mathematics? Can mathematics practice have other goals, and *rewards,* besides academic performance and achievement?**

### Problem Statement

K–12 mathematics is largely taught via direct instruction, offered to students with little to no rationale, and focused on external and extrinsic motivators, metrics, and indicators (grades, scores, etc.). Students are under- or unmotivated. At the same time, fear of failure is so high that it leads to significant incidence of clinical anxiety.

---

### Proposed Solution

Develop a one-on-one AI-assisted learner-directed learning application that supports intrinsic motivation, exploratory learning, and productive failure in interaction with advanced mathematics.

---

### Rationale

When new technologies emerge, the first phase of integration tends to consist of grafting old methods onto the new medium. It takes time, effort, and creativity to leverage the affordances of the new technology to amplify and ultimately transform pedagogy to realize its benefits.

In this context, we propose to explore how **new, novel affordances of AI-assisted learning** might transform the student experience of mathematics learning...

### Intrinsic Motivation in Mathematics Learning

We’ll consider how our design might support the intrinsically motivating satisfactions defined by Self-Determination Theory: competence, autonomy, and relatedness (Deci & Ryan, 1985, 2000, 2017)...
