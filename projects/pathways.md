### Target Audience
Any digital literate individual interested in sharing and archiving local community knowledge (ex. Place-based history). 

### Identified Learning Need
As physical third spaces fade and online ones take their place, the sense of community has moved into the digital realm, eroding our capacity to feel grounded and connected in the spaces we physically inhabit. Having a solid and stable connection to the space around them allows people to participate in a diversity of rich experiences, helping them form a strong local identity in their community of practice (Wenger 1999). Research has shown that a sense of community and identity fosters a deeper sense of interconnectedness (Pei et al., 2023), and the feedback and dialogue that emerges from extended interactions between community members encourages inquiry-based experiential learning (Dewey, 1938). Shared experience through interpersonal relationships and interactions, such as discussions, storytelling, and games, are key to developing critical skills such as communication and collaborative problem-solving (Panqueva, 2000). Building a community through shared immersive experiences can help cultivate a deeper sense of belonging and learning.

### Rationale for AI Assistance
A physical audio walk immerses learners in the authentic spaces of the history they are exploring, fostering both situated and embodied cognition to enrich understanding and retention (Bruner, 1991). While traditional audio walks rely on pre-existing narratives, incorporating AI allows learners to actively contribute to content creation by submitting archival knowledge, personal stories, or other resources about a place. The AI synthesizes these inputs into a coherent, immersive narrative, dynamically structuring content, guiding transitions between sites, and linking stories to physical locations. This process not only personalizes the learning experience but also preserves learner autonomy, prompting reflection, exploration, and socially mediated engagement through discussion prompts or challenges (Jian, 2023).

Incorporating AI into the audio walk experience allows learners to personalize their journey by submitting archival knowledge and preferences. This personalization enables the AI to curate content that aligns with individual interests and prior knowledge, thereby optimizing cognitive load and enhancing learning outcomes (Sun & Yu, 2018). Furthermore, situating curated content within physical spaces reinforces experiential and inquiry-based learning, enabling learners to construct knowledge actively while developing a sense of belonging within the community they are exploring (Dewey, 1938). In this way, AI transforms the traditional audio walk into a personalized, interactive, and reflective learning experience that bridges archival knowledge, learner input, and embodied engagement with the environment.
