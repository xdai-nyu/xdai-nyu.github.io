### Target Audience
Graduate-level NYU students and faculty who are curious about the space they inhabit or want to feel more connected to the community they belong to (370 Jay Street). 

On a broader level, our audience is tourists, residents, and urban explorers interested in hidden and local histories and learning more about the space around them. While our current design is hyper-localized to 370 Jay Street, we hope that this experience can serve as a template for different locations in the future.

### Identified Learning Need
As physical third spaces fade and online ones take their place, the sense of community has moved into the digital realm, eroding our capacity to feel grounded and connected in the spaces we physically inhabit. Having a solid and stable connection to the space around them allows people to participate in a diversity of rich experiences, helping them form a strong identity in their community of practice (Wenger 1999). Research has shown that a sense of community and identity fosters a deeper sense of interconnectedness (Pei et al., 2023), and the feedback and dialogue that emerges from extended interactions between community members encourages inquiry-based experiential learning (Dewey, 1938). Shared experience through interpersonal relationships and interactions, such as discussions, storytelling, and games, are key to developing critical skills such as communication and collaborative problem-solving (Panqueva, 2000). Building a community through shared immersive experiences can help cultivate a deeper sense of belonging and learning.

### Rationale for AI Assistance
A physical audio walk immerses learners in the authentic spaces of the history they are learning, fostering both situated and embodied cognition to enrich the learning experience. The audio walk’s clear narrative arcs are grounded in constructivist learning principles, which improve understanding and retention (Bruner, 1991). Incorporating AI into the audio walk can elevate the audio walk experience even further, reacting dynamically to the environment and prompting learners to engage with their surroundings on a deeper, more personalized level. An AI agent can transform the solo experience of audio walks into an interactive and reflective learning experience that empowers learner autonomy, prompting individual reflection or engaging learners in constructive dialogue on topics that interest them. In addition, AI can analyze large datasets from user interactions to tailor content to individuals, offering a great capacity for personalization (Jian, 2023). Studies show that personalization helps reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load, while improving their ability to memorize and make connections (Sun & Yu, 2018).  By drawing on these features, an AI-powered audio walk can facilitate a more meaningful connection between the learner and their environment, empowering them to engage more deeply with the community they belong to.
