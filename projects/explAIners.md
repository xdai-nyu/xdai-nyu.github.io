## Project Brief:
<p> 
  A learning need that students require is individualized support. Providing personalized feedback can help students understand their strengths and challenges in order to continue onto their next steps. Our target audience will be 3rd - 5th grade (writing in response to texts) elementary school students who are learning in the classroom or at home who may require feedback on their reading responses.
